## Intro

This document goes hand in hand with the RMarkdown file "Fluctuating Turbidity
Data Conversion" (fluctuating_turbidity_data_conversion.Rmd). It will
eventually become a part of that file, but for troubleshooting's sake I will
be working on them separately for now.

## Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#setting the working directory
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "D://2 Day Mini Kaolin Turb Flux Experiment/testing")
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(zoo)
#the number of fish per group
fish = 4
```

## Reading in the files

```{r file read in, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#reading in the file names into a list
filelist <- list.files(pattern = "*.csv")
#from list of files, creating a list of dataframes from each file
#excluding the columns that are either empty or don't contain data we're using
fishlist <- lapply(filelist, read_csv, col_select = c(3:4, 6:8))

#replacing the inf TRex uses in place of NAs with NAs
Inf2NA <- function(v) replace(v, is.infinite(v), NA)
fishlist <- lapply(fishlist, function(d) replace(d, TRUE, sapply(d, Inf2NA)))
```

## Processing the files

```{r loop, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}

i = 1
for (k in 1:(length(filelist)/fish)) {  #across the whole file list
  #combining the files from all fish per video to be analyzed collectively
  fourfish <- fishlist[i:(i+(fish-1))]
  i = i+fish
  
  
  ##standardizing the length of each fish's file in a video so all files start at
  ##frame 0 and end at the last frame of the longest file
  
  #determining the last frame of a video by taking the largest frame value
  #from all of the fish datafiles
  maxframe <- max(fourfish[[1]][,"frame"])
  
  #creating a dataframe filled with NAs to pad the missing frames from each file
  dfNA <- data.frame(frame = 0:maxframe, fish_detected = NA, angle = NA,
                     X = NA, Y = NA)
  
  for (z in 1:fish) {  #across one video of files
    #finding the frame the fish datafile starts on
    minfish <- min(fourfish[[z]][,"frame"])
    
    #adding NA rows from dfNA to start of file when it starts on a frame later
    #than 0
    if (minfish > 0) {  #across one fish file within a video
      fourfish[[z]] <- rbind(dfNA[1:(minfish),], fourfish[[z]])
    }
    
    #finding the frame the fish datafile ends on
    maxfish <- max(fourfish[[z]][,"frame"])
    
    #adding NA rows from the dfNA to the end of a file when it ends earlier than
    #the longest fish file from the video
    if (maxfish < maxframe) {  #across one fish file within one video
      fourfish[[z]] <- rbind(fourfish[[z]], dfNA[(maxfish+2):(maxframe+1),])
    }

    #keeping speed and polarity calculations separate for simplicity (as if anything about this is simple)
    dist <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = nrow(fourfish[[z]]), ncol = 2))
    colnames(dist) <- c("frame", "distance_cm")
    dist$frame <- fourfish[[z]][,"frame"]
      
    #a dataframe to hold the distance values (calculated) and the polarity
    #values (exported from TRex, in radians)

    #calculating the distance values
    for (t in 1:(maxframe-1)) {
    #Mistake here
    #What we need is a total distance moved across three seconds
      #That does NOT mean finding the distance between where the fish was at
      #the start of second one and where the fish was at the end of second three
      #It means finding the distance moved between every frame of those total
      #90 seconds
      move <- sqrt(((fourfish[[z]][(t+1),"X"]) - (fourfish[[z]][t,"X"]))^2 +
                      ((fourfish[[z]][(t+1),"Y"]) - (fourfish[[z]][t,"Y"]))^2)
      dist$distance_cm[t+1] <- move

    simpspeed$time_s <- 1:(floor(nrow(dist)/30))
    
    #within one fish's file
    #calculating the non-rolling speed values
    #dividing by 30 because videos are ~30 frames per second (29.7 frames)
    #and using floor() to round down to the nearest whole second
    n = 1
    for (s in 1:(floor(nrow(dist)/30))) {
      simpspeed$speed[s] <- sum(dist$distance_cm[n:(s*30)])
      n = n + 30
    }
    
    #calculating a rolling speed average from the base speed values to account
    #for noise in tracking
    rollspeed <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = floor(maxframe/30)), ncol = 2)
    colnames(rollspeed) <- c("time_s", "speed")
    #rollapply is better than rollmean when there are NAs, so using that here
    #width refers to the time step window of the average where the window value
      #indicates the total number of values averaged for the mean
    #using default alignment of the window so that the window is centered on the
      #focal observation point
    #excluding NAs from the average calculations but counting them as time
      #time points in the window
    rollspeed$speed <- rollapply(simpspeed$speed, width = 6, FUN = function(x)
                                 mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), partial = TRUE)
    
  }
  i = 1
