## Introduction

This file was created to analyze data collected during a series of experiments
conducted from March 30 to August 14, 2022 on the effects of fluctuating
visibility on the behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio). All data analyzed in this
file was collected using the automated animal tracking system TRex
(Walter & Couzin, 2021) and focuses on the social behaviors. For more
information on the experiments see the readme file located in this repository.

The specific measures analyzed here are shoal area, mean neighbor distance and
polarity. One value was calculated for each measure for each recording.
Shoal area was calculated by drawing a line between the midpoints of
each fish to create a polygon and then calculating the area in centimeters.
Mean neighbor distance was calculated by taking the distance between the
midpoints of each fish and then calculating the mean in centimeters. Polarity
was calculated by taking the circular variance of the angles of each fish and
then subtracting this value from one. Polarity is a value from 0-1 where values
closer to 1 indicate the fish are oriented in similar directions while values
closer to 0 indicate fish are oriented in highly different directions.

Mean shoal area and mean neighbor distance were analyzed using linear mixed
models with tank ID as a random factor to account for multiple recordings of
each tank. Because polarity is 0-1 bounded it has a non-normal distribution so
we analyzed it using a generalized linear mixed model with a beta family
distribution and tank ID as a random factor. All model residuals were visually
inspected for model assumptions. When necessary, data was log-10 transformed
to meet model assumptions.

## Direct Comparisons

For the direct comparison models we compared the response variables of the compared experiments during the recording on the second day where the flux and stable conditions had the same visibility (recording 4).

The first set of direct comparisons is between the acute (two day) clay experiment and the stirred dye experiment to explore any potential differences between clay- and dye-imparied visibility. The second set of direct comparisons is between the stirred and unstirred dye experiments to determine if there was an effect of stirring on fish response to the treatments.

```{r direct}
#sub-setting the data to only include recording 4
direct_claydye <- clay_dye %>%
                  filter(recording == "rec4")
